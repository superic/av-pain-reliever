# Architecture

Locked architectural choices, the high-level shape of the codebase, and the prototype findings that informed each major adapter (IOKit USB watcher and CoreAudio). The "Real-launch findings" section captures bugs surfaced once the .app bundle was distributed and run from `/Applications`.

For decisions about the product itself see [docs/decisions.md](decisions.md). For the implementation history of each module see [docs/port-history.md](port-history.md).

## Locked architectural choices for the Swift port

These can be considered final unless we discover a blocker:

- **App target**: SwiftUI app with `LSUIElement = true` (no Dock icon, menu
  bar only). Bundle ID `com.ericwillis.avpainreliever`.
- **Frameworks**:
  - `IOKit/usb` for USB device enumeration + notifications via notification
    port + run loop integration
  - `CoreAudio` for default device get/set, called directly. The C APIs
    are uniform enough that ~120 lines of `AudioController.swift` covers
    the full enumerate + read-default + set-default surface the engine
    needs. (Originally planned to wrap with `SimplyCoreAudio`; the
    CoreAudio prototype proved that's unnecessary — see "CoreAudio
    prototype findings" near the end of this doc.)
  - `Foundation.Process` to shell out to `obs-cmd` (reuse the Phase 1
    dependency rather than write a native WebSocket client)
  - `UserNotifications` for the toast (replaces `hs.notify`)
  - `os.Logger` for logging into Console.app (replaces file appender)
  - `AppKit.NSStatusItem` for the menu bar icon + menu
  - `Sparkle` 2 (SPM) for auto-updates with EdDSA signing
- **Distribution**: GitHub Releases via GitHub Actions on tag push. Build,
  sign with Apple Developer cert (in repo secrets), notarize via `notarytool`,
  upload `.app.zip`, update Sparkle appcast.
- **Apple Developer Program** ($99/yr) — confirmed user is fine paying.
- **Config file format**: TOML. JSON is too noisy; YAML's whitespace
  sensitivity is dangerous; TOML is the cleanest fit for human-edited config.
  Lives at `~/Library/Application Support/AVPainReliever/profiles.toml`.

`StatusItem` is the central UI surface — most users never open the preferences
window. Menu structure (locked — confirmed 2026-04-30 that no manual override
is needed; menu is informational + admin only):

```
🎧 Home Office             ← current profile (status item title)
─────────────
Open OBS
Reveal log file in Finder
─────────────
Preferences...            ← opens SwiftUI preferences window
Quit AV Pain Reliever
```

No "Switch to" submenu. No "Auto-detect" toggle. The engine is always in
auto-resolve mode, deterministically driven by attached USB devices.

## IOKit prototype findings

A throwaway single-file Swift prototype lives at
[`prototypes/usb-watcher.swift`](prototypes/usb-watcher.swift) and proves
that IOKit USB watching produces output equivalent to Hammerspoon's
`hs.usb.watcher`. Run it with `swift prototypes/usb-watcher.swift`.

### Did it work first try?

Almost. The IOKit pieces themselves (matching dict, notification port,
run-loop wiring, drained iterators) worked first compile. The two surprises
were both about Swift / Foundation behavior, not IOKit:

- **stdout was block-buffered** when the script wasn't attached to a TTY,
  so the snapshot output didn't appear until the process exited. Fix:
  `setbuf(stdout, nil)` at startup. The production app logs through
  `os.Logger`, so this is a script-only quirk — but worth remembering if
  we ever ship a CLI surface alongside the `.app`.
- **The IOKit registry entry name was the wrong fallback** for unnamed
  devices. `IORegistryEntryGetName` returns the *class name*
  (`"IOUSBHostDevice"`) when a device has no instance name set, not an
  empty string. Hammerspoon renders these as `"?"`. Fix: drop the
  `IORegistryEntryGetName` fallback entirely; just use `"?"` when
  `kUSBProductString` (the `"USB Product Name"` property) is missing.
  Affects ~2 devices on Eric's docked setup (LG UltraFine internal hub
  legs).

Snapshot output on Eric's machine matches the most recent Hammerspoon
log's `--- attached USB devices ---` block one-for-one (every vid/pid
present, every name match), plus an iPhone connected since the log was
captured. IOKit iteration order differs from Hammerspoon's — not a
problem for the engine since `ProfileResolver` works on a *set* of
fingerprints, but worth knowing: **never assume a stable enumeration
order from `IOServiceGetMatchingServices`**. If the Swift port ever
needs deterministic output (logging, hashing for change detection),
sort by `(vid, pid, name)` after enumeration.

### Anything harder than expected?

- **The Swift Clang importer doesn't surface IOUSBLib's `#define`
  constants**. `kUSBVendorID`, `kUSBProductID`, `kUSBProductString`,
  `kIOUSBDeviceClassName` — none of them are visible from Swift.
  Hard-code the literals (`"idVendor"`, `"idProduct"`, `"USB Product
  Name"`, `"IOUSBHostDevice"`). Stash these as named constants in
  `USBWatcher.swift` so it's clear they're IOKit-defined and not
  arbitrary.
- **`IOServiceMatching` consumes one CF reference per call site**.
  `IOServiceGetMatchingServices` and each `IOServiceAddMatchingNotification`
  each consume one. So for snapshot + add-notification +
  remove-notification = three calls to `IOServiceMatching`, not one.
  Cheap and obvious in retrospect, but the symptom of getting it wrong
  is `kIOReturnNoMemory` from the second consumer, which is misleading.

### Anything easier than expected?

- **The notification-port → run-loop integration is one line:**
  `CFRunLoopAddSource(CFRunLoopGetMain(), IONotificationPortGetRunLoopSource(port).takeUnretainedValue(), .commonModes)`.
  The `.takeUnretainedValue()` is the only Swift-vs-C ergonomic friction.
- **Captureless Swift closures convert cleanly to `@convention(c)`
  function pointers** as long as they only reference globals, not local
  variables. `IOServiceMatchingCallback` is `@convention(c)`, and the
  prototype's drain-state lives in a global `final class` so the closures
  can mutate it without capturing. The production `USBWatcher` should
  pass an `Unmanaged<Self>` via the `refCon` parameter instead — cleaner
  than globals for a real class.
- **The "first-match callback fires once per already-attached device on
  registration" gotcha was easy to handle with a single boolean flag**
  per iterator. The first manual drain after
  `IOServiceAddMatchingNotification` is silent (those are devices we
  already printed in the snapshot pass); subsequent drains print
  `[add]` lines. Same shape for `[remove]` except the initial drain is
  empty in practice.

### Patterns worth keeping for the production port

```swift
// 1. Property reads — boilerplate-heavy, factor into helpers up front:
private func intProperty(_ entry: io_object_t, _ key: String) -> Int? {
    guard let raw = IORegistryEntryCreateCFProperty(
        entry, key as CFString, kCFAllocatorDefault, 0
    ) else { return nil }
    return (raw.takeRetainedValue() as? NSNumber)?.intValue
}

// 2. Iterator drain — used in every callback; must run to exhaustion or
//    the notification port stops delivering events:
private func drain(_ iterator: io_iterator_t, body: (io_object_t) -> Void) {
    var entry = IOIteratorNext(iterator)
    while entry != 0 {
        body(entry)
        IOObjectRelease(entry)
        entry = IOIteratorNext(iterator)
    }
}

// 3. Manual first-call to arm the notification — easy to forget:
let iter = subscribe(kIOFirstMatchNotification, addedCallback)
addedCallback(nil, iter) // drains initial set + arms notification port
```

The production `USBWatcher` should also:

- Hold the notification port in a property and `IONotificationPortDestroy`
  it on deinit (not needed for a prototype, but a singleton in a
  long-running app should clean up).
- Sort the snapshot enumeration by `(vid, pid, name)` for log fidelity
  if we want the Swift app's logs to diff cleanly across runs.
- Pass `self` via `refCon` (`Unmanaged.passUnretained(self).toOpaque()`)
  rather than relying on globals for callback state.
- Match `IOUSBHostDevice` only — `IOUSBDevice` is the legacy XHCI class
  and returns nothing on Apple Silicon. Confirmed empirically on
  macOS 26 Tahoe.

### Effort estimate update

The original estimate had IOKit USB watcher at **4-6h** (with the
"notoriously fiddly" caveat). After the prototype, revise down to
**2-3h** for the production version: the heavy lifting (matching dict,
notification port, run-loop integration, iterator draining, callback
shape) is now de-risked. What's left is:

- Wrapping the prototype's globals in a real class with `init`/`deinit`
- Routing events through a Combine `PassthroughSubject` or
  delegate-style callback to the `Debouncer` → `ProfileResolver`
- `os.Logger` integration in place of `print`
- Unit-testable seams (probably an injected `USBEnumerator` protocol so
  `ProfileResolver` tests don't actually touch IOKit)

### Open questions resolved

None of the "Open questions" above were directly answered by this
prototype — it was a feasibility check, not a UX experiment. But the
"locked architectural choices" entry for **"`IOKit/usb` for USB device
enumeration + notifications via notification port + run loop
integration"** can now be considered **validated**, not just locked.

## CoreAudio prototype findings

A second throwaway single-file Swift prototype lives at
[`prototypes/audio-defaults.swift`](prototypes/audio-defaults.swift) and
proves CoreAudio can do everything `hs.audiodevice` does for us in the
engine: enumerate input/output devices, read the current system defaults,
and switch defaults by `AudioDeviceID` (which `AudioController` will look
up by name). Run it with `swift prototypes/audio-defaults.swift` — it
prints a snapshot + current defaults + a non-destructive set-default
verification (sets each default to its *current* value, exercising the
write codepath without disrupting the user's audio).

### Did it work first try?

Yes. Snapshot output matches the engine's `--- audio devices ---` log
block **line-for-line, in the same order** — including the cosmetic
detail that some devices (CalDigit, Yeti, LG UltraFine) appear twice as
separate `AudioDeviceID`s with `in=true/out=false` and
`in=false/out=true`, while a few (Microsoft Teams Audio) appear once
with `in=true out=true`. Unlike IOKit, CoreAudio's
`kAudioHardwarePropertyDevices` returns devices in a stable order — no
need to sort for log fidelity.

Default-device set verification: `noErr` for both input and output. The
production `AudioController` can use the same
`AudioObjectSetPropertyData(kAudioObjectSystemObject,
DefaultInput|OutputDevice, …)` call to actually switch when a profile
applies.

### Anything harder than expected?

- **Generic property-read helper hits a Swift compiler warning.** The
  obvious `func readProperty<T>(...) -> T?` that wraps
  `AudioObjectGetPropertyData` produces *"forming
  UnsafeMutableRawPointer to a variable of type 'T'; this is likely
  incorrect because 'T' may contain an object reference."* The compiler
  can't prove `T` is trivially copyable. For a production
  `AudioController` we should either constrain to non-class types or
  just write per-type helpers (`readUInt32(...)`,
  `readCFString(...)`); the prototype takes the per-type route after
  hitting the warning. Minor friction, not a blocker.
- **`kAudioObjectPropertyName` returns `Unmanaged<CFString>`, not
  `CFString`.** Easy to miss until you look at the readProperty signature.
  Pattern: read into `Unmanaged<CFString>?`, then `takeRetainedValue() as
  String`. The CoreAudio docs do say "the caller is responsible for
  releasing", which is the Unmanaged hint.

### Anything easier than expected?

- **The C-style API is more uniform than I expected.** Every read is
  `AudioObjectGetPropertyData(object, &address, 0, nil, &size, &out)` —
  same shape regardless of what you're reading. Wrapping this in a
  small `address(selector, scope:)` helper kills 80% of the boilerplate
  and the rest reads almost like Swift. The "notoriously fiddly" part
  of the original effort estimate was overblown — at least for the
  default-device subset we need.
- **The original plan to wrap CoreAudio behind `SimplyCoreAudio` may be
  unnecessary** for the engine's actual needs. The full read+write
  surface for `AudioController` is exactly four operations:
  enumerate-devices, get-name, get-streams-by-scope, and
  set-default-device-for-role. With ~80 lines of helpers we have all of
  them in pure Swift + CoreAudio. SimplyCoreAudio adds an SPM dep, an
  observation/notification surface we don't need (the engine doesn't
  watch for audio device changes — only USB events trigger reapplies),
  and a Combine layer that doesn't fit our otherwise-imperative
  `ProfileApplier`. **Recommendation: drop SimplyCoreAudio from the
  locked architectural choices**, write `AudioController.swift` as
  ~120 lines of CoreAudio directly. Saves a dep and cuts a layer.
- **Set-default verification with current value is a clean test
  pattern.** Setting input→input and output→output exercises the entire
  write path with zero user-visible side effect. Worth keeping for
  `AudioController`'s init: a one-time self-set on launch as a
  smoke-check that the codepath is healthy. (Or a unit test seam.)

### Patterns worth keeping for the production port

```swift
// Address helper — kills CoreAudio's biggest source of boilerplate:
private func address(
    _ selector: AudioObjectPropertySelector,
    scope: AudioObjectPropertyScope = kAudioObjectPropertyScopeGlobal
) -> AudioObjectPropertyAddress {
    AudioObjectPropertyAddress(
        mSelector: selector,
        mScope: scope,
        mElement: kAudioObjectPropertyElementMain
    )
}

// Capability check — does this device have streams in a given scope?
private func hasStreams(_ id: AudioDeviceID, scope: AudioObjectPropertyScope) -> Bool {
    var addr = address(kAudioDevicePropertyStreams, scope: scope)
    var size: UInt32 = 0
    AudioObjectGetPropertyDataSize(id, &addr, 0, nil, &size)
    return size > 0
}

// Find a device by name + capability — what AudioController.setInput(name:)
// will need. The prototype only iterates; the production version is the
// same loop with `==` matching:
func findDevice(named target: String, scope: AudioObjectPropertyScope) -> AudioDeviceID? {
    for id in allDeviceIDs() where deviceName(id) == target && hasStreams(id, scope: scope) {
        return id
    }
    return nil
}
```

### Effort estimate update

The original estimate had **CoreAudio adapter via SimplyCoreAudio: 2-3h**.
After this prototype, the estimate is unchanged at **2-3h** but the work
shifts: instead of wrapping SimplyCoreAudio, we wrap raw CoreAudio in
`AudioController.swift`. Same amount of code, one fewer dep. The SPM
manifest gets shorter.

### Architectural choice update

Update the "Locked architectural choices" section: replace
> `CoreAudio` for default device get/set, wrapped with `SimplyCoreAudio`
> SPM dep to hide the worst of the C APIs

with:

> `CoreAudio` for default device get/set, called directly. The C APIs
> are uniform enough that ~120 lines of `AudioController.swift` covers
> the full enumerate + read-default + set-default surface the engine
> needs. **No SimplyCoreAudio dep** — see "CoreAudio prototype
> findings" for why.

(Done — this section already updated in the same change.)

### Open questions resolved

None — same as the IOKit prototype, this was a feasibility check, not a
UX experiment. But two locked architectural choices were validated AND
revised: CoreAudio direct (instead of via SimplyCoreAudio) is now the
plan for `AudioController`.

---

## Real-launch findings (post-first-run)

The first real launch surfaced one behavior gap that was fixed in
the same commit.

### Feature gap: no signal when user docks somewhere unfamiliar

**Symptom**: User feedback during the real-launch session — "the
app should notice a new configuration and ask to set it up when it
happens."

**Implementation**: `Engine.onUnknownLocation: ((Set<USBDevice>) ->
Void)?` callback fires when the resolver picks the empty-fingerprint
fallback profile (i.e., specificity 0, matches anything) AND there
ARE devices currently attached. Doesn't fire on plain undocked
state (empty attached set + fallback resolution = "I'm at the
laptop", that's normal). Doesn't fire on specific-fingerprint
matches (those are known locations, not new). Three Engine tests
cover the three cases.

`AppDelegate` wires this to a one-shot toast: "New location
detected: N USB devices attached. Add it to your profiles so AV
Pain Reliever can switch automatically." The "one-shot" gating
re-arms when the user next resolves to a real-fingerprint profile,
so docking at a second new location after configuring the first
gets a fresh toast.

### Notifier (UserNotifications stand-in)

`UserNotifications` (`UNUserNotificationCenter`) requires a real
bundle identifier, which our SPM-built dev binary doesn't have.
Stop-gap: `AppleScriptNotifier` shells out to `osascript -e
'display notification ... with title ...'` via `Foundation.Process`.
Works without a bundle, surfaces under whatever app `osascript`
runs as. Will swap for `UNUserNotificationCenter` when the signed
`.app` ships. Recorded as a TODO in the file's doc comment.

`AppDelegate` fires the notifier:
- On profile change (different name from the previous evaluation)
- On unknown-location detection (one-shot per stretch of
  unknown-ness, see above)

The initial-evaluation toast on launch is intentionally
suppressed — the menu-bar title is already showing the correct
profile, so a duplicate toast would be noise.

### Effort estimate update

Original estimate was **2-3 h** (Xcode project) + **1-2 h**
(StatusItem) = **3-5 h**. Actual: ~30 min for the SPM-based app
target with menu-bar UI. The Xcode project itself is deferred to
the code-signing phase, where it's necessary for proper `.app`
bundle output.
