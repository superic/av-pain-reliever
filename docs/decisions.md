# Decisions

What we know to be true about this product. The "Validated decisions" section is settled by the shipped implementation; the "Open questions" section is the punchlist of things that still need real-world data to answer.

For ongoing implementation work see [docs/architecture.md](architecture.md). For the V2 virtual-camera design see [docs/virtual-camera.md](virtual-camera.md).

## Target product

A distributable macOS menu-bar app that:

- Ships as a signed + notarized `.app` from GitHub Releases
- Auto-updates via Sparkle 2
- Has a real menu-bar UI for status and profile management
- Runs self-contained: no shell scripts, no third-party tools
- Configurable for non-developers (a typical non-coder collaborator should
  be able to install it without ever opening a terminal)

External behavior: USB-driven location detection → switch system audio
defaults + camera selection → notify.

## Validated design decisions

These are settled and validated by the shipped Swift implementation:

- **USB vendor + product ID is enough for fingerprinting** (no serial number
  matching needed). Confirmed by user not having two identical docks; revisit
  if a future user reports collisions.
- **1.5 second debounce window** correctly collapses dock-enumeration bursts
  into a single evaluation. Tested on CalDigit TS3 + LG UltraFine; full burst
  takes ~1 second, well under the window.
- **"Most-specific match wins" with alphabetical tiebreak** is the right
  resolution rule. Tested by having work-office + conference-room share the
  office dock; conference-room wins when its extra device is present.
- **"Same as System" for audio + the app's own virtual camera in Zoom/Slack
  is the right pattern.** No per-app routing complexity needed.
- **Notifications are useful, with a Settings toggle for users who prefer
  them off.** No structural changes needed; users who find toasts annoying
  can disable via Settings ("Send notifications when profiles change").
- **Profile change triggers don't need WiFi BSSID, Bluetooth, or calendar
  signals as a fallback.** USB alone has been sufficient for Eric's 4
  locations. Revisit if a real user can't disambiguate USB-only.
- **`profiles.toml` hand-editing is acceptable for power users**, but the
  wizard is the right onboarding for non-power-users. The Swift app should
  not require config-file editing for normal use, but should allow it as
  escape hatch.
- **No manual override.** Profile resolution is always driven by the
  currently-attached USB devices. The user has no use case for "force
  profile X regardless of what's plugged in." Implication: the menu bar
  UI does NOT need a "Switch to ▶" submenu in v1. The status item is
  display-only — current profile name + an icon, no profile picker.
  Confirmed by user 2026-04-30.
- **No per-app audio routing.** "Same as System" in every app is sufficient.
  No use case for Slack mic ≠ Zoom mic. Implication: Swift never needs to
  integrate with app-specific audio APIs (no aggregate device hacks, no
  per-app `defaults` plist editing). Engine only ever
  touches system default input/output. Confirmed by user 2026-04-30.
- **No Mac App Store distribution.** Confirmed 2026-05-10 after weighing
  the costs: the app runs unsandboxed today (IOKit USB watching, CMIO
  camera-extension installation, CoreAudio default-device switching all
  rely on direct entitlements), and we've invested heavily in Sparkle +
  dev/stable channels + the `dev/build` sign-notarize-staple flow.
  Moving to the App Store means a sandbox rework (real risk of App Review
  pushback on a virtual-camera-plus-audio-switcher) and throwing out the
  release infrastructure. Wins (discoverability, payment infrastructure,
  trust signal beyond notarization) don't justify the cost at current
  user-base scale. Direct distribution via notarized Developer-ID
  binaries on GitHub stays the path. Revisit if a real distribution
  ceiling emerges, monetization becomes interesting, or a reviewer
  roundup gates on App Store presence.

## Open questions

These can only be answered by real-world use. Each one is tagged with the
trigger condition that should prompt asking the user.

### Detection accuracy

- **Q: Has the 1.5s debounce ever been wrong?**
  Trigger: profile fires twice, fires with wrong fingerprint, or takes
  noticeably long. Implication: tune the constant, or make it configurable.
- **Q: Have you ever needed a non-USB signal to disambiguate locations?**
  Trigger: two locations have the same USB peripherals. Implication: app
  may need WiFi BSSID, Bluetooth peripherals, time of day, or calendar event
  matching. Each is a real chunk of work.

### Scope creep candidates

Things a real user might ask for. Not in v1, but kept here for v2 prioritization:

- Per-profile *display arrangement* (move windows when docking)
- *Crash and error reporting* (opt-in telemetry for unhandled crashes,
  plus an in-app viewer for recent OSLog failures so the user notices
  silent breakage without running `log show`)
- *Localization.* All in-app strings are currently English literals;
  v2 would migrate to `LocalizedStringResource` / `String(localized:)`
  with `.xcstrings` catalogs. Cool-to-have, not a v1 gate.
- *Live virtual-camera preview in Settings → Camera tab.* Settings UI
  becomes a consumer of the virtual camera the same way Zoom is.
  Doubles as a self-diagnostic so users can see the feed without
  opening Zoom. Caveat: host-as-consumer interaction has a known bug
  class (see CHANGELOG "Self-source feedback loop on late consumer
  connect", 2026-05-05); relevant lesson when implementing.

## v1 graduation criteria

What needs to be true to commit to a stable v1.0 feature surface and tag
`v1.0.0`. The "Already met" bullets capture what's done today; the gate
is the short forward-looking list at the bottom.

### Already met (as of 2026-05-09)

- **Virtual camera path battle-tested.** The visibility-race cluster
  (PRs #79, #80, #81) closed out the bug class that was surfacing
  repeatedly. Hold-last-frame, format conversion, and the
  extension-activation flow are all stable.
- **Wizard validated on external users.** 2 external users completed
  Add Profile without help.
- **Save Logs for Support shipped (PR #78).** External users have a
  path to surface bugs.
- **Sparkle release flow stable.** 15 v0.2.x releases shipped;
  auto-update working end-to-end.
- **Engine has substantial test coverage.** Resolver tiebreak fixes
  (PRs #69, #70, #71) covered. Pure logic at 73-100% line coverage
  across the engine target.

### Forward-looking gate

- **Soak time.** No new critical-class bug PR landing on `main` for
  14 consecutive days. Today (2026-05-09) shipped 3 visibility-race
  fixes; clock starts now.
- **`tools/todo.md` Active section is empty at tag time.** Graduation
  lands at a stable resting point, not mid-feature.
- **Author judgment.** A few more weeks of daily use without surprise.
  No mechanical trigger; the author calls when ready.

### Explicitly NOT v1 gates

These were considered and deferred:

- *Crash + error reporting:* listed in Scope creep candidates for v2.
- *App-target test coverage at engine parity:* active fun work in the
  persistent todo, not a gate. Target is 80% line coverage on non-UI
  files; SwiftUI views and OS-integration code excluded by design
  (they need snapshot or integration tests, not unit tests).
- *Live virtual-camera preview in Settings:* listed in Scope creep
  candidates for v2.
- *Localization:* listed in Scope creep candidates for v2.
- *External user count threshold:* considered, dropped as a gate
  because chasing a number distracts from quality signal.

## Resolved on 2026-05-09 (walkthrough)

Items moved out of "Open questions" / "Scope creep" because the walkthrough
on 2026-05-09 either confirmed enough real-world signal to settle them, or
explicitly dropped them as out-of-product:

- **vid/pid collision.** No collision across the author + 2 external users.
  Already covered by the validated decision above; the open question was
  redundant.
- **Menu bar shows current profile name.** Default ("yes") shipped and
  works for all 3 users. No noisiness complaints.
- **External user wizard sticks.** 2 external users completed the wizard
  without help. Save Logs for Support (PR #78) covers future stick reports.
- **Toast notifications useful or annoying?** A Settings toggle ("Send
  notifications when profiles change", defaults on) already ships, so
  this is user preference, not a code question. The walkthrough surfaced
  the question but the answer was already in the product.
- **Dropped scope-creep candidates** (out-of-product, not pursued):
  per-profile wallpaper; per-profile Karabiner profile switching;
  per-profile Bluetooth device connect/disconnect; per-profile VPN
  enable/disable; per-profile focus mode / Do Not Disturb.
