# Decisions

What we know to be true about this product. The "Validated decisions" section was settled before the Swift app was built; the "Open questions" section is the punchlist of things that still need real-world data to answer.

For ongoing implementation work see [docs/architecture.md](architecture.md). For the V2 virtual-camera design see [docs/virtual-camera.md](virtual-camera.md).

## Target product

A distributable macOS menu-bar app that:

- Ships as a signed + notarized `.app` from GitHub Releases
- Auto-updates via Sparkle 2
- Has a real menu-bar UI for status, manual override, profile management
- Runs self-contained — no Lua, no shell scripts, no third-party tools
- Configurable for non-developers (a typical non-coder collaborator should
  be able to install it without ever opening a terminal)

External behavior: USB-driven location detection → switch system audio
defaults + camera selection → notify.

## Validated design decisions

These are settled by Phase 1 use and can be assumed when we start Swift:

- **USB vendor + product ID is enough for fingerprinting** (no serial number
  matching needed). Confirmed by user not having two identical docks; revisit
  if a future user reports collisions.
- **1.5 second debounce window** correctly collapses dock-enumeration bursts
  into a single evaluation. Tested on CalDigit TS3 + LG UltraFine — full burst
  takes ~1 second, well under the window.
- **"Most-specific match wins" with alphabetical tiebreak** is the right
  resolution rule. Tested by having work-office + conference-room share the
  office dock; conference-room wins when its extra device is present.
- **`obs-cmd` shell-out is fine** as the OBS integration. No need to write a
  native obs-websocket WebSocket client — the CLI is stable, fast, and handles
  the auth dance for us.
- **OBS scenes are the right unit of switching.** Each scene bundles camera +
  overlays + audio routing. The "one scene per location" mental model is clean.
- **Camo is not a viable alternative.** Verified during planning: Camo's only
  automation surface is macOS Shortcuts, which can switch the *device* but not
  a saved overlay/scene combo by name. If overlays are wanted, OBS is the
  answer.
- **"Same as System" + OBS Virtual Camera in Zoom/Slack is the right
  pattern.** No per-app routing complexity needed.
- **`hs.notify` notifications are useful.** No real-world annoyance reported
  yet; will revisit if user complains.
- **Profile change triggers don't need WiFi BSSID, Bluetooth, or calendar
  signals as a fallback.** USB alone has been sufficient for Eric's 4
  locations. Revisit if a real user can't disambiguate USB-only.
- **`profiles.toml` hand-editing is acceptable for power users**, but the
  wizard is the right onboarding for non-power-users. The Swift app should
  not require config-file editing for normal use, but should allow it as
  escape hatch.
- **No manual override.** Profile resolution is always driven by the
  currently-attached USB devices. The user has no use case for "force
  profile X regardless of what's plugged in." Implication: the menu bar
  UI does NOT need a "Switch to ▶" submenu in v1. The status item is
  display-only — current profile name + an icon, no profile picker.
  Confirmed by user 2026-04-30.
- **No per-app audio routing.** "Same as System" in every app is sufficient.
  No use case for Slack mic ≠ Zoom mic. Implication: Swift never needs to
  integrate with app-specific audio APIs (no Audio Hijack-style aggregate
  device hacks, no per-app `defaults` plist editing). Engine only ever
  touches system default input/output. Confirmed by user 2026-04-30.

## Open questions

These can only be answered by real-world Phase 1 use. Each one is tagged with
the trigger condition that should prompt asking the user.

### Detection accuracy

- **Q: Do you ever own two devices with identical (vid, pid)?**
  Trigger: a profile resolves wrong because two locations share peripheral
  models. Implication: Swift may need USB serial number matching, which is
  cheap to add via IOKit but absent in `hs.usb.attachedDevices()` (the Lua
  wrapper doesn't expose it).
- **Q: Has the 1.5s debounce ever been wrong?**
  Trigger: profile fires twice, fires with wrong fingerprint, or takes
  noticeably long. Implication: tune the constant in Swift, or make it
  configurable.
- **Q: Have you ever needed a non-USB signal to disambiguate locations?**
  Trigger: two locations have the same USB peripherals. Implication: Swift
  may need WiFi BSSID, Bluetooth peripherals, time of day, or calendar event
  matching. Each is a real chunk of work.

### User experience

- **Q: After a couple weeks of use, are the notifications useful or
  annoying?** Trigger: user complaint OR explicit ask after ~2 weeks.
  Options: silent / banner-only / banner+sound / configurable per-profile.
- **Q: Should the menu bar icon show the current profile name?**
  Trigger: user asks how to tell which profile is active without opening
  the menu. Implication: status item title shows pretty profile name.
  *(Default: yes. Cheap to implement, useful at-a-glance signal. Revisit if
  user finds the title bar noise distracting.)*

### Scope creep candidates

These are things a real user might ask for. Not in v1, but capture them as
they come up so we can prioritize for v2:

- Per-profile *display arrangement* (move windows when docking)
- Per-profile *wallpaper*
- Per-profile *Karabiner profile* switching
- Per-profile *Bluetooth device* connect/disconnect
- Per-profile *VPN* enable/disable
- Per-profile *focus mode* / *Do Not Disturb*
- *Crash and error reporting* (opt-in telemetry for unhandled crashes,
  plus an in-app viewer for recent OSLog failures so the user notices
  silent breakage without running `log show`)

### Onboarding

- **Q: Did the first external user get all the way through the wizard
  without asking for help? Where did they stick?** Trigger: after the
  first non-author user runs the wizard. Implication: directly informs
  whether the in-app onboarding is scalable, OR if it needs a more
  guided first-run flow.
