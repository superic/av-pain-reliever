/// Compact tinted capsule used for at-a-glance status badges

/// "Debug override" on the virtual-camera status row,
/// "Not connected" / "Travels with you" / "Important: <category>"
/// on wizard device rows.

/// White text on a saturated tint reads cleanly in both light
/// and dark mode. Earlier wizard pills used `.black` text on a
/// 0.85-opacity tint; that contrast degraded in dark mode where
/// the tint dimmed toward the background. Settling on a single
/// idiom (full-opacity tint, white text) keeps the pills legible
/// in both appearances and removes the visual drift between the
/// settings pills and the wizard pills.
