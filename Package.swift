// AV Pain Reliever — Swift Package manifest for the menu-bar app.
//
// `swift run AVPainRelieverApp` from the repo root launches the
// menu-bar agent. `swift test` runs the full test suite. The
// package will eventually be wrapped by an Xcode project for the
// signed-and-notarized .app distribution build, but the SPM
// manifest stays the canonical source of dependencies + targets.
//
// The earlier Hammerspoon-based prototype that this Swift app
// supersedes is archived under `prototypes/hammerspoon/`; see
// `prototypes/README.md` for context.
